	/** Bindings in which the gatherings are held together by adhesive only, without any form of sewing or stitching. They may, however, be reinforced by glueing strips of material into recesses cut across the spine. The earliest examples of European adhesive bindings recorded on printed books are English, with one example dating from the 1620s and a small group from the period 1670-1690. German examples have been identified from the second half of the eighteenth-century and very occasionally in England at the end of the eighteenth century. The small number of survivals from these early periods is a reflection either of the ephemeral nature of some of the texts bound in this manner, or the inherent instability of such structures before the introduction of flexible adhesives. The so-called &#039;Perfect binding&#039; patented in 1836 and probably first used in 1839 (Middleton, p.30), in which caoutchouc was used as the adhesive, proved no more durable. */

	/** Adhesive cases are attached to completed bookblocks by means of adhesive alone. The cover constitutes a separate complete unit made up of one or more components, depending on whether it is made from one piece of cover material, or from several components (i.e. boards, covering material, spine piece, etc.). Books bound in this way are conventionally known as case bindings. Their order of construction differentiates them from bindings in which the boards are first attached to the bookblock by adhesive to the endleaf guards, endleaf stubs or full leaves before they are covered with a covering material. Even though they may appear superficially to be the same, in that adhesive alone is used to attach the boards and cover to the bookblock, the latter is an inboard structure. The first recorded adhesive cases are German and date from the second quarter of the sixteenth century, and this history of case binding seems to be exclusively German until the mid-eigtheenth century. */

	/** Boards in which pieces of a previously-manufactured sheet material are held together with an adhesive. Such boards were from an early date also known as pasteboards, but this term has traditionally been used almost exclusively of boards made from paper, and within that category, has been used rather indiscriminately of different types of paper board and cannot be relied on to denote exclusively this type of board manufacture. Adhesive laminates have also been made from parchment, leather, tawed skin, textile, papyrus and hemp fibre as well as paper (or combinations of these), and had the advantage for the binder both of allowing for any thickness of board, depending on the number of laminations used and of being able to be made in the binder&#039;s workshop rather than bought from specialist board manufacturers. They could also be used effectively at a thinness at which wooden boards became too brittle to use safely. Adhesive-laminate boards using sheets of parchment are known in western Europe from as early as the twelfth century, but the use of paper is particularly associated with the Islamic world and for this reason early western European examples mostly come from Spain. By the mid-fifteenth century, however, paper adhesive-laminate boards became increasingly popular in Italy and from there spread northwards until, by the first quarter of the sixteenth century, they can be found in all western European countries (Hobson, Humanists, Appendix 1). They can often be distinguished from couched-laminate boards where damaged corners are visible. Adhesive laminates tend to break down cleanly into their separate layers, whereas couched-laminate boards separate leaving fibres attached between and to the separating surfaces. */

The only exception is where books are sewn on flat tape supports at two-hole stations and the thread passes across the back of the supports and not round them. Where this happens, there will be a gap in the thread in the inner fold behind each support, but the gathering is still sewn all-along. */

	/** The covering material is prevented from adhering to the spine-folds or spine-linings of the bookblock during the covering process by means of the insertion of an infill or hollow. This has the effect of allowing thicker books or books printed on thicker paper or with narrow inner margins to open more easily without crushing the covering material on the spine and thus damaging lettering and gold-tooling. It is associated with books sewn on recessed supports with smooth spines, which, because of the comparative thinness of recessed supports, have more flexible spines which are therefore more likely to have this damaging effect on gold-tooled spines. The construction of an artificial hollow back was described by Dudin (1773) and it is probably a consequence of the re-introduction of recessed sewing supports for high-quality books with extensively tooled spines in France and England in the 1760s. */

They are likely to be found only on wooden boards, though some pastiche antiquarian bindings in Britain of the early nineteenth century created rather exaggerated versions of centre chamfers in couched-laminate boards. Their widespread popularity in German-speaking countries led, in the eighteenth century, to the covering skins on flat board surfaces being tooled with fillets in blind in imitation of centre bevels.

The protective function of chemises made from plain alum-tawed skin (a typical Romanesque type, but found throughout the middle-ages) was often subsumed into decoration by the use of exotic and expensive silk textiles, worked with metal threads in silver and gold and with elaborate tassels on the corners, intended to show the wealth and taste of the owner. It is this latter type which is most often known as a chemise. The characteristic knotted cover of the girdle-book was sometimes formed by a secondary cover or chemise, often of leather, the skirt of which was gathered together in an elaborate knot or decorated ring which allowed it to hang from a belt, or girdle (Szirmai, p.236-7).

The teeth lie over each other in the spine panels, creating two thicknesses of lining. In French bindings of the seventeenth century and later the linings could then be stiffened by an application of animal glue. Although mostly made of parchment, Italian examples using paper have been recorded from the late sixteenth century. They can be found with both square and tapered teeth. The unslotted, outer halves of each lining, the lining extensions, in the joints, can be found adhered to the inside of the boards of inboard bindings or left unadhered in laced-case bindings. The cases of German one-piece adhesive-case bindings of the early sixteenth century have also been found adhered to comb-lining joints. Comb linings were used in the late middle-ages in both Germany and Italy, though they fell out of use in the former early in the sixteenth century and in the latter by the end of the same century. They were taken up in France in the second quarter of the sixteenth century at a time when Italian binding decoration was fashionable in France, and by the end of the century they had become a standard part of French inboard bindings, and remained so until at least the mid-eighteenth century. In bindings in good condition, they can often be recognised by the presence of the joints, which may adhered to the inside of boards, and by the cut-out around each sewing support along the joints. */

Because such boards were made in paper mills, they are also known as millboard, though this term has been so generally used of all paper boards in the literature that it has largely lost its specific meaning. Couched-laminate boards made from sheets of a cream- or grey-coloured paper were introduced after adhesive laminates, but are found by the end of the fifteenth century and become more common in all parts of Europe through the sixteenth century. They were used in Britain but not in large quantities until the introduction of couched laminates made from rope-fibre in the last quarter of the seventeenth century, which remained in widespread use in Britain only through to the nineteenth century. The surfaces of the boards may bear the impression of the screens on which they were made, which may have the appearance of a woven screen of varying degrees fineness or coarseness (textile?) or a laid pattern, again of varying qualities. They can often be distinguished from paste laminates where damaged corners are visible. The layers of paper separate leaving fibres attached between and to the separating surfaces, whereas paste laminates tend to break down cleanly into their separate layers. */

The edges of a cover which extend beyond the size of the bookblock but which are not creased along the edges of the bookblock should not be described as cover extensions. They simply have more or less wide squares. Cover extensions have for many years been known as yapp edges, getting their name from the nineteenth-century London bible binder, William Yapp, who created limp bindings with drawn-on leather covers which overlapped the edge of the bookblock at head-, tail- and fore-edge (circuit cover extensions). He was undoubtedly not the first binder to do this (the technique was known from the middle-ages), and although his name is firmly attached to this type of edge treatment, it is anachronistic to use it of bindings made before the nineteenth century, and has little meaning in languages other than English. Cover extensions can also be found on the fore-edge of one side of the cover only.

The cover lining is distinguished from boards in that both sides are part of a single continuous piece of material wrapped around the spine, as opposed to boards which must always be separate entities. Cover linings were never intended to be left exposed and will therefore also always be found with covers of parchment folded over them, through both of which the endbands slips are laced. Cover linings are a French phenomenon and first appear in the last quarter of the 16th century. Early in the 17th century, French binders simplified the structure by folding the parchment cover over the cover lining and attaching both at the same time by means of the endband slips, without lacing the sewing support slips through the cover lining (the slips were usually cut off at the joints). In this form the cover lining survived until the end of the eighteenth century. */

	/** There are two types of cover which may typically be found on a book, primary and secondary. The primary cover is the material that constitutes the immediate covering of the completed binding, but not including additional, secondary, covers such as chemises or decorated paper over a plain primary cover. For inboard bindings, the primary covering material is used to cover the boards and spine, either completely, as in full bindings, or partially, as in half and quarter bindings. In all case bindings, and bindings with external sewing supports and longstitch bindings, the case itself may also be the covering material, and thus serve a dual function as both primary covering (which therefore may be given a secondary, decorated cover) and structural component. A secondary cover can be added in addition to a primary cover (but cannot be a secondary cover unless there is a primary cover already in place), either as protection or further embellishment of the book. In the latter case they are often made from decorated materials (most often textile or paper), but purely protective secondary covers can be made made from plain materials such as tanned or alum-tawed skins or paper, or recycled paper or parchment. They may be contemporary with and part of a complete binding, or may have been added afterwards (sometimes many years afterwards) to suit the taste and needs of a later owner. Many bindings with primary covers in parchment also have a lining of white paper under the parchment, intended both to brighten the parchment and make it opaque and also to soften the parchment with the moisture from the adhesive used to stick together so that it could be moulded around the book. Such linings on Dutch laced-case bindings with boards were adhered to the fleshside of the parchment before the book was covered, and could not be described as primary covers, but linings on Dutch inboard bindings of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were usually adhered to the book before the parchment was adhered around it. Such lining could therefore be thought of as primary covers, but their intended use as a lining and the fact that they would never have been left as covers in themselves means that they should always be thought of as a lining of the primary cover and not as an actual primary cover. Some bindings with embroidered covers may have similar linings. */

	/** A bookblock with laced-on boards made of paper which were cut at head and tail with the boards whilst preserving squares on the boards at both edges. This was made possible because the lacing allowed the board to be moved a short distance up and down the joints. If, therefore, the boards were both pushed as far as they would towards one end of the bookblock and the other end was then cut with the boards, when the boards were returned to their original position, they would project beyond the cut edge of the bookblock. The process could then be repeated for the other end. The process had the advantage that the edges of the boards would always be exactly parallel to the edges of the bookblock. The process can be recognised if an exposed head or tail edge of one of the boards has on it the same decoration as the corresponding bookblock edge, as the edges were often decorated as soon as they were cut and while they were still in the cutting press. The fore-edges of the boards would be cut individually and not with the fore-edge, which would be cut on its own with the assistance of a trindle. Fore-edges of books with rounded spines (and therefore rounded fore-edges) were not usually coloured in the press, as the whiteness on the surfaces of the leaves along their edges would show when the round shape was returned the bookblock after it was released from the laying press and the trindles were removed. The edge would be coloured after this, and if the boards were closed, the colour will be found on the fore-edge squares of the boards and not on their edges. If the fore-edge was to be gilded, this would be done in the press on a flat edge, a process known as gilt in the square (gilding in the round is a nineteenth-century development). */

Separate endleaves and integral endleaves can be combined at either the left or right ends of the textblock, and the endleaves at left and right can be made up differently. This is often the case in printed books where the printed text supplies blank leaves at either end of the textblock, allowing the binder to leave out the same number of added leaves, but have the same number of endleaves at each end of the bookblock. In some student books and other working copies of books, gatherings of blank paper were added to the end of the textblock for writing on, and it is sometimes hard to make a distinction between these and endleaves, especially when the final leaf of the final gathering is used as a pastedown, and a careful description will be necessary. When describing a book, endleaves are normally found on either side of the textblock.  Endleaves may serve either as pastedowns or free endleaves, depending on whether or not they are pasted to the inside of a board or cover. For reasons of economy, binders would often chose paper that, when folded into endleaves, was somewhat smaller than the dimensions of the textblock (undersize endleaves).

	/** Skins from animals in the Caprinae subfamily to which goat and sheep both belong. The goat is an animal with a coat of coarse hair that leaves clearly defined hair follicles in the skin, grouped in three in waving lines across the skin, usually in combination with a rich, deep grain. The best quality skins have a dense network of fibres in the epidermis, which, in combination with stable organic tanning agents such a sumac, produced skins of great beauty with outstanding durability. The best skins were imported (hence the names they were given in Europe – maroquin, turkey leather and today niger – named after the countries they came from. The sheep is a closely related animal which, depending on the proportion of coarse hairs and fine wool hairs in the skin will look more or less like goatskin, and if there is a very high proportion of coarse hair (hairsheep), the skin is, to the eye, more or less indistinguishable from goatskin. This confusion was compounded in the early eighteenth century when Edward Harley, Earl of Oxford, unable to obtain sufficient quantities of high-quality turkey leather (tanned goatskin) for his enormous library, began to import a bright red skin directly from Morocco made from the skins of hairsheep. Because of where it came from, it was called ‘morocco leather’, which means that English and French morocco leather came from different animals – with vastly different levels of durability, to which the deterioriated condition of many of Lord Harley’s morocco-covered books will testify. While the true, high-quality tanned goatskins are usually readily identifiable, the difficulty in distinguishing hairsheep from poorer quality goatskin, especially when made into parchment, means that it may be best to describe these skins as caprinae, knowing that the skin lies somewhere within this spectrum of the animal kingdom, but without having to be too specific. The many bindings covered in brown, tanned sheepskin found on cheap editions such as schoolbooks in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries have clearly visible hair follicles, and are clearly not goatskin, but the brightly coloured skins of hairsheep have often been mistaken for goatskin. If it is not possible to identify the animal precisely, it is better to hedge your bets. */

	/** The process by which a case cover is attached to the bookblock by means of sewing the gatherings to the cover through pairs of holes between which the thread is visible on the spine of the cover, creating one or more longstitch sets, though the threads are often hidden by a secondary cover. Properly speaking, such a structure should be called &#039;longsewing&#039;, but the term longstitch, deriving from the German &#039;langstich&#039;, is so deeply embedded in the literature as to be inextricable. The cover was usually trimmed at the same time as the head, tail and fore-edges of the bookblock were cut, with the result that the cover and the bookblock are of the same height and width, and the cover has neither squares nor turn-ins. Covers can be made with turn-ins, but for this to work, the edges of the bookblock must either be left uncut, or be cut before the book is sewn. Because the cover is attached to the bookblock as the book is sewn, the structure has to be non-adhesive and cannot have any spine linings. The longstitch structure was used in Middle Ages for blank-book or stationery bindings, and the structure was transferred to printed books in Italy as early as the 1480s, as it provided an inexpensive and convenient way to protect and hold together books as they moved through the booktrade to their first owners. Although it is to be presumed that many longstitch bindings will have been rebound by later owners, and the covers therefore lost, the versatility of the structure and its ease of use by readers has meant the many examples have survived. Because of its low cost, it became increasingly associated with inexpensive books such as guide books, popular devotional literature, romances, play-texts and opera libretti, though its ease of opening and flexibility, the consequences of its non-adhesive spine, made it also suitable for music books, as the pages would lie open without trouble at any opening, a necessary virtue for use by a musician. Although very common in Italy, they are also found in the Low Countries and in Germany, in which latter country they seem to have been popular as bindings for student texts. In the Low Countries the structure survived into the twentieth century on almanacs, a testament to the practical virtues of the structure. */

Outside hooks can be found used on their own, in multiples or as one of several components within a single endleaf unit. A common type consists of a single piece of sheet material folded in half and then folded again along the folded edge to create a folded stub. Because this format does not allow the inside of the folded stub to be pasted, this type is rarely used as a pastedown. Outside hook endleaves were in regular use across Europe from the second half of the sixteenth and right through seventeenth century. They survived well into the eighteenth century, but were less popular in Britain than on the continent of Europe from the mid-seventeenth century. A popular continental variation was to use a sheet of decorated paper folded within a sheet of plain paper, and then to use the decorated paper as a pastedown. Where the outer full leaf is used as a pastedown (pasted on top of the stub or stubs), they can be a little difficult to recognise, but in almost all cases the sewing thread will be seen to tear though the fold along the spine edge of the pastedown, thus revealing their construction. */

Pastedowns must by definition be made towards the end of the binding process, after covering, but if an endleaf element was adhered to the inside of the boards before the book was covered, these should be described either under primary board attachment or as board stabilisers and not as pastedowns. Pastedowns are also known as board sheets (C. Clarkson). */

The materials used include cartonnage, parchment, leather, horn and wood. Pierced supports, as the materials used indicate, can either be rigid or more or less flexible. Entire bookblocks were sewn through pierced supports, often using patterned sewing, and they should not be confused with the sewing restraint technique in which the thread from the outermost gathering at each end of the bookblock only was sewn through the supports in order to prevent the gatherings sliding off the ends of the sewing supports. On some longstitch bindings sewn through full covers of cartonnage, the sewing was reinforced by the addition of pieces of thin, flexible parchment or leather placed on the outside of the covers which were intended to prevent the thread from tearing through the cartonnage. These are usually so thin and flexible that they could not have been used as supports on their own and can safely been described as longstitch reinforcements. Where they are thick and stiff, they should, however, be described as pierced supports. It may not always be easy to distinguish which is which. */

The production of skins with artificial grains would appear to have been a development of the late eighteenth-century, possibly in response to the introduction of expensive straight-grain leathers. Skins with an impressed straight grain are therefore not uncommon, but other grains can be found, e.g morocco grain and pebble grain. These grains are also found on bookcloths and paper. Skins with artificial impressed leather grains can be found at many levels of work below the highest, but are found most often towards the bottom end, using varieties of inexpensive coloured tanned sheepskin to make more attractive-looking school books, children&#039;s books, pocket books, diaries, etc. The decorated bindings often found on liturgica, always books produced in large numbers and often sold bound, will also make frequent use of skins with artificial grains. */

	/** Marks left by the blade of a plough. When used on an edge under heavy pressure in a laying or cutting press, a well-set-up plough with a properly sharpened blade is unlikely to leave any marks on the edge, but the area of the head- and tail edges of a bookblock close to the spine could not be heavily compressed because of the swelling caused by the sewing thread. The plough blade was therefore likely to leave parallel marks in this slightly spongy area of the bookblock as it was passed backwards and forwards over the edge. When the bookblock expanded slightly as it was taken out of the press and perhaps had the spine reshaped for the attachment of boards, the straight, parallel plough marks would become curved, often in a pattern of parallel, curved lines converging towards the centre of the spine. The distance between each line will indicate the width of each cut by the plough. In some examples the curved lines can extend further along the edge, indicating that the bookblock edge was in some way deformed in the laying press, and when taken out and straightened up, bent the plough marks into long, curved lines. */

	/** The first, and often only, cover on a binding, and which could serve as the finished external surface of the binding. The term is used to distinguish the covering first put onto the book before the addition of a secondary cover. It is not possible to have a secondary cover unless there is already a primary cover, and the primary cover will always cover at least the spine and the spine-edges of the boards if not the whole book. On some medieval bindings it is possible to have a full secondary cover over a quarter primary cover, resulting in a binding in which the secondary cover will be in direct contact with the larger part of the boards. This does not make it a primary cover, as the quarter spine covering will always have been there first. Where case covers are concerned, the primary cover may stand alone. A primary covering may take the form of a part cover and therefore be made of one or more different materials. Case covers present a more complex problem of definition, in that the primary cover of laced-case binding, one-piece case binding or longstitch binding through a full cover is the case cover itself. Any decorated paper subsequently wrapped around them is therefore a secondary cover. If an adhesive case cover is made in the German manner as a three-piece case cover, it must, by analogy, constitute the primary cover and the decorated paper often added to them would also be a secondary cover. However, in the type of case developed in the 1820s, in which the boards and spine inlay were held together by their covering (usually of bookcloth), the separate boards and spine inlay cannot really be thought of as a cover in themselves (unlike the German three-piece case which, although made of three separate components, is attached to a bookblock as a single unit). It would seem, therefore, sensible for the components which make up a full case cover (i.e. one which reaches around the spine from fore-edge to fore-edge) to be regarded as a primary cover from the moment when they are joined together as a single unit. Any subsequent covering should be thought of as a secondary covering. A longstitch guard, therefore, because it does not extend to the fore-edges of a bookblock, does not constitute a primary cover, which role is taken by the full cover which was folded over it. */

Such books were described as being &quot;bound in the common manner&quot;.

These should be known as primary tackets to distinguish them from other types of tacket. These tackets could also be taken through a cover, either in single- or multi-gathering books, where they might also have been taken through pierced sewing supports, but because they still perform the function of holding the leaves together as well as attaching a cover, they should still be called primary tackets. Where a cover is attached to a previously- and independently-sewn bookblock by tackets, the tackets should be called secondary tackets. The simplicity and speed of execution of primary tacketing made it useful as a provisional structure, used perhaps to hold gatherings together during the writing and assembly of hand-written manuscripts (see quire tackets), prior to binding the gatherings together in a more complex structure. It is, however, often difficult to know whether a simple, inexpensive structure was intended to be provisional or permanent, and the term &#039;provisional&#039; should therefore only be used where there is additional evidence to indicate its temporary status. */

	/** A board material made in single thick sheets from coarsely pulped paper, typically acquired from the trimmings from the cut edges of bookblocks, waste printed or manuscript paper, etc. When it breaks down at broken corners, it will not divide into layers but into very uneven flake-like fragments of paper. Pulp boards were made in a variety of thicknesses, and thinner boards were often laminated together with an adhesive to build up the thickness for larger books. The pulp appears to have been formed into sheets over a woven screen, the impression of which is therefore found on one side of the board. These screens appear to have been made of a textile, often of a very coarse weave, not unlike sacking. Careful binders made sure that the screen-side of the board was placed against the bookblock, so as not to show through a leather cover. Pulp boards are typical of British binding from the last quarter of the sixteenth century through to the third quarter of the seventeenth century, after which they become increasingly rare, except for the cheapest books, on which they may occasionally be found up until the early nineteenth century. They do not appear to have been much used on the continent of Europe. They were made both by professional suppliers of board and, from the appearance of tubs and moulds in inventories of binders&#039; workshops (Strickland Gibson, 1907), sometimes by the binders themselves, who would collect edge trimmings from books they bound and other waste material in a waste bin (often the tub under the laying press) in their workshops for this purpose. As a result, small bits of other types of material, including textile, thread, parchment, quill trimmings, fragments of wood, metal pins, etc., may be found in the boards (Middleton). */

	/** Quarter covers are those which cover only the spine and the back edge of the boards. Books with quarter covers are also known as &#039;quarter bindings&#039;, sometimes qualified by the covering material on the spine, as in quarter calf. The proportion of the boards that they cover varies enormously according to where and when the books may have been bound, but the most common proportion is from about one eighth to one quarter of the board (the name presumably coming from the latter proportion). The term is problematic when applied to fifteenth-century German examples where the covering material may extend to over half of the width of the board, at which point the term &#039;quarter&#039; seems inadequate. It is, however, such a firmly established term that it is not likely that it can be changed. Instead, a qualifying measurement of the proportion of the board covered in such books may need to be added where a more precise definition is required, as in &quot;a quarter (55%) binding&quot;. The primary reason for the use of quarter covers was economy, and they are often found on bindings with other indicators of low-cost in terms of structural short-cuts and inexpensive materials. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they were also used, together with half covers to show off expensive materials on the spines of books shelved vertically with their spines outwards, in the modern manner. Quarter covers are commonly found on south German and north Italian bindings in the second half of the fifteenth and first half of the sixteenth centuries, typically used with wooden boards which remained uncovered, though in some German examples, the exposed wooden boards were sometimes decorated with blind-tooled fillets. In the sixteenth century, German binders often continued to use quarter covers of tanned or alum-tawed skin over paper boards or scaleboards, which were covered before the quarter spines were put onto the book. Any of the conventional covering materials might be used to make quarter covers, and they are found on a variety of different structures, both as primary covers and secondary covers. Unexpected combinations of materials can be found on English bindings of the late eighteenth century, such as tanned goat-skin, parchment or russia leather on the spines with marbled calf leather on the sides. Such bindings need to be carefully distinguished from those with full covers of one material and onlays on the spine of a different material, such as a high-quality tanned goatskin onlay over a full cover of calf leather. Quarter covers of leather with a plated straight-grain pattern and sides with the same straight-grain pattern and often of the same colour were popular in France in the first quarter of the nineteenth century. Somewhat confusingly, quarter bindings were often described in the 18th century as &#039;half bindings&#039;, and care must be taken when reading such descriptions to work out exactly what is meant.  */

In European bookbinding, sca&#039;boards were most often obtained from beech, whose fine, straight grain made it most suitable for this purpose. It differs from the thicker, cleft planks also obtained by splitting timber in that it is much thinner, ranging from approximately 3mm down to less than 1mm. At such thicknesses, the wood is easily broken and it was therefore sometimes laminated to or between pieces of paper board. It was used most often on small-format books in cheap bindings, such as school books and inexpensive devotional literature from at least the mid-sixteenth century. It was seen to be an inferior quality material, presumably on account of its brittleness, and attempts were made in England in the sixteenth century to prevent its use. It was in much more common use in Germany, but was used to varying extents in all western-European countries. In an apparent contradiction of preferred practice, some binders, most notably in New England, but also in Germany, used sca&#039;boards with a horizontal grain, to reduce the likelihood of the boards breaking along the grain by having one end-grain edge of each board braced against the joint of the bookblock. */

Many plain laced or adhesive cases of cartonnage were originally given secondary covers of decorated paper, but all other types of binding could be given secondary covers, either by professional bookbinders or by their owners at any time after they were made.  Secondary covers added at a later date are often identified by the fact that their turn-ins will be adhered over the pastedowns of the original bindings and their turn-ins at head and tail will be cut at the joints. Dust wrappers should also be considered as secondary covers, albeit somewhat ephemeral ones. A secondary cover always requires the existence of a primary cover.

	/** Sewing stations are created by passing a thread through a spine fold when sewing a book. Each sewing support will therefore correspond to a sewing station. Sewing stations include change-over stations or chain-stitch stations in an unsupported structure. Some broad sewing supports have a sewing hole on each side of them and these should count as a single sewing station with two holes (two-hole sewing station). Very occasionally, three-hole stations may be encountered. In a structure with sewing supports there will usually be a change-over station above and below the supported area of the spine, thus adding two extra stations to the number of sewing supports. If there are no separate change-over stations, the number of sewing stations will be the same as the number of sewing supports. In some German bindings with Kapitalbünde, the binders worked chainstitches across the spine between the Kapitalbünde and the closest sewing supports, thus creating two additional stations. In some English bindings of the second half of the seventeenth century with bookblocks sewn on recessed sewing supports, additional recesses were cut across the spine between the sewing supports and sometimes also at head and tail close to the change-over stations to allow the spine adhesive to penetrate to the inner bifolia of the gatherings in order to reinforce multi-section sewing and the often rather weak structures found on such books. The term sewing station has been used by some writers to include only those stations where there are sewing supports and not to include the change-over stations, but this would mean that unsupported sewing structures would have no sewing stations at all, which is clearly not the case. Sewing stations can either be made as a book is sewn by pushing a needle through the spine folds of otherwise unmarked gatherings, or they can be prepared in advance of sewing (marking up), which will result in neater, faster and more regular sewing. Different methods were used to do this. */

	/** A somewhat obscure and ambiguous term which seems to have been used, at different times, for very different materials. The word, along with its French and German equivalent, chagrin, is said to have been derived from the Persian expression saghari, which applies to a leather produced from an ass, and which had an indented grain surface caused by spreading seeds of Chenopodium (goose foot) over the surface of the moist skin, covering the skin with a cloth, and trampling them into the skin. When the skin was dry the seeds were shaken off, leaving the surface of the leather covered with small indentations. In the 17th and early 18th centuries, however, the term &quot;shagreen&quot; (or &quot;chagrin&quot;) began to be applied to a leather made from sharkskin having a curious grain surface of lonzenge-shaped, raised and spiny scales of minute size, the character of which is difficult to perceive without optical assistance. This material will most often be found on almanacs and liturgica, without gold-tooling and often with silver, furniture and clasps. The term was also applied to the skin of a rayfish (probably Hypolophus sephen), which is covered with round, closely set, calcified papillae resembling small pearls. In its natural form it has been used for many years in both the East and the West for a variety of purposes, including bookbinding; however, in the early years of the 18th century it became the practice to grind the surface flat and smooth, leaving only the pattern of small contiguous circles. The skins prepared in this way are more likely to be found covering small boxes, instrument cases, etuis, etc. than books on which the material appears to be used very rarely. This is the skin which for a century has been called &quot;shagreen&quot;; how confusion arose with sharkskin, which is completely different both in character and in appearance, is not clear. */

	/** The projections of a board beyond the head-, tail-, and fore-edges of a bookblock are called squares. The origin of the term is not recorded, but a medium square may be taken as a projection which is equal to the thickness of the board. Below this measurement, the squares can be described as narrow and beyond it, as wide. Measuring the width of squares is not always easy, as bookblocks which have dropped between their boards because of vertical storage will give false measurements, and the binders of cheaper books often took little trouble either to cut the board edges parallel to the bookblock or even to cut them straight. An approximate assessment relative to the size of the bookblock is often therefore the most satisfactory. It may also be found that the squares are not of equal width on each edge, often leaving the fore-edge noticeably wider than the head- and tail-edges, but also, on occasion, with unequal squares at head and tail. The boards may also be cut to the size of the bookblock, cut flush together with the edges of the bookblock, or, in the case of Greek bindings, the bookblock may be cut level with the boards after it has been sewn to the boards. In all these cases, there will be no squares. On rare occasions, boards may be cut smaller than the bookblock (undersize), most often where the bookblock is uncut and retains its deckle edges. Care must be taken, however, not to mistake unequal squares on wooden boards which are the result of the subsequent shrinking of the wood across the grain with unequal squares which were intended by the binder. In bindings with squares this can result in boards without squares on the fore-edge (if the grain direction of the wooden board is vertical) and in bindings originally without squares, it can result in the wooden boards drawing back several millimetres from the edges of the bookblock. Boards made from paper are not liable to this type of shrinkage. However, the paper boards used in parchment-covered laced-case bindings with boards were cut without squares on the fore-edge if the cover was to have cover extensions, whilst retaining squares at head and tail.  The definition of squares given above works only for boards, but for limp covers of paper or parchment, the term &#039;squares&#039; is not particularly useful, as the thickness of the cover is almost always going to be narrower than the projection of the cover beyond the bookblock. Measurements are not necessarily useful as the width may vary within each side of the cover, let alone between the two sides. Identifying only those which are flush, or unusually narrow or wide is perhaps the most practical way of dealing with this question. */

If the outermost gatherings of such a book are made in a different format from the rest of the gatherings (e.g. four leaves as opposed to eight leaves, or outside hooks instead of bifolia), or made from a different, possibly coloured, paper, these can be described as endleaves, and the other leaves as the textblock, together making the bookblock.  */

The three-piece case was first used in Germany at the beginning of the eighteenth century and in France at the end of the eighteenth century.

The German term for the three-piece case, &#039;gebrochener Rücken&#039;, meaning literally &#039;broken back&#039;, is presumably a reference to splitting a one-piece case into two sides with a connecting spine-piece. This meant that it was possible to have a thinner flexible spine-piece that allowed the book to open whilst having a rigid board on each side to support and protect the bookblock, a dual function that was not possible with the one-piece case.

On some bindings with widely-spaced sewing supports they can be found used in pairs in which case each should be described separately as they may be made from different materials. The panel transverse lining is one of the most common types of spine lining, and was used in all European countries from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century, though it was much less commonly used in France and Britain than elsewhere, even allowing for a general reluctance in Britain to use spine linings at all. There is a marked difference in the height of the linings within the panels formed by the sewing supports between northern and southern Europe. South of the Alps and in Spain, the linings will generally fill the entire height of the panels in which they are found (full-height transverse spine linings), whereas in Germany and the Low Countries, they are more likely to be much narrower, often filling less than 50% of the height of the panel (narrow transverse spine linings). */

	/** Process of decorating sheets of paper or other sheet materials by transferring colours floating on the surface of a size to the sheets by laying them directly onto the colours. In a flat trough filled with water and a surface-tension medium like gum tragacanth, liquid colours are sprinkled on the surface using various brushes and then manipulated into the desired arrangement on the surface of the size. A sheet of paper is then directly laid onto the colours to transfer them to the paper. Each sheet is thus unique, as although the same basic design may be copied, there will always be differences. The liquid colours are sprinkled on the surface of the size using various brushes and successively shaped into patterns drawn with points, rakes (or ‘combs’), or dropped one after the other to create more random patterns. Once the desired pattern is achieved in the trough, a sheet of paper (usually blank but sometimes already marbled with another design) is laid on the surface of the size, where the design is permanently transferred to the paper by absorption, and then lifted up, after which it is hung up to dry. When dry, the decorated paper can finally be burnished to produce an attractive gloss and to seal the surface of the colours.

They got their name from being imported through Smyrna (modern Izmir) in Turkey, while what appear to be identical skins were known in France as maroquin, as they were imported into France from Morocco. The skins imported into England directly from Morocco for Lord Harley’s library in the early 18th century, and known in England as morocco leather, were taken from hairsheep and are of inferior quality. The distinction between turkey leather and morocco leather was maintained within the booktrade until the last quarter of the eighteenth century, when the English term morocco began to be applied to the same sumac-tanned African goatskins that had been called turkey leather up to that point, and this is now the general modern usage. The confusion resulting from this can be reduced either by using the French word for the skins used in France (maroquin) or by qualifying the word morocco as French morocco where relevant. Where it is possible to distinguish them, the simplest answer is to refer to the higher-quality skins as tanned goatskin, but the terminological distinction between Turkey leather and Lord Harley&#039;s (i.e. hairsheep) morocco leather is as complex as identifying the skins themselves can often be, especially as so many bindings described as &#039;morocco bindings&#039; in library and booksellers&#039; catalogues from the nineteenth century onwards may or may not actually be covered in goatskin (see the entry under &#039;goat-sheep (caprinae skins)&#039;. */

	/** This hierarchy provides values for the CIDOC-CRM E53 Place:

This class comprises extents in space, in particular on the surface of the earth, in the pure sense of physics: independent from temporal phenomena and matter. 
The instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of “immobile” objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks. A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. It may be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation.
It is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.
Any object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination. The model foresees the notion of a &quot;section&quot; of an E19 Physical Object as a valid E53 Place determination. */

This class comprises identifiable features that are physically attached in an integral way to particular physical objects. 
Instances of E26 Physical Feature share many of the attributes of instances of E19 Physical Object. They may have a one-, two- or three-dimensional geometric extent, but there are no natural borders that separate them completely in an objective way from the carrier objects. For example, a doorway is a feature but the door itself, being attached by hinges, is not. 
Instances of E26 Physical Feature can be features in a narrower sense, such as scratches, holes, reliefs, surface colours, reflection zones in an opal crystal or a density change in a piece of wood. In the wider sense, they are portions of particular objects with partially imaginary borders, such as the core of the Earth, an area of property on the surface of the Earth, a landscape or the head of a contiguous marble statue. They can be measured and dated, and it is sometimes possible to state who or what is or was responsible for them. They cannot be separated from the carrier object, but a segment of the carrier object may be identified (or sometimes removed) carrying the complete feature. 
This definition coincides with the definition of &quot;fiat objects&quot; (Smith &amp; Varzi, 2000, pp.401-420), with the exception of aggregates of “bona fide objects”. */

	/** The sewing, often purely decorative, which wraps around a sewn endband core but which is not tied down into the bookblock. Secondary endband sewing therefore has little or no structural function, but in some medieval and the early sixteenth-century bindings, it could also be used to secure the covering material on the spine of the book to the sewn endbands, and thus ensure that it did not arch away from the spine of the bookblock when the book was opened, an especially important function in non-adhesive bindings. Secondary sewing could be very elaborate, worked in silk (perceived as a less durable material and seldom used for primary sewing until the seventeenth century), and include crowning cores, gold and silver threads and elaborate plaiting in coloured tanned or alum-tawed skin. The working in thread of worked stuck-on endbands should also be described as secondary sewing, for although there is no primary sewing, the endband is attached to the bookblock by adhesive, and the working in thread, which does not penetrate the text gatherings, is exactly the same as the secondary sewing on a worked endband. Some of the single sewing supports, or Kapitalbünde, found at the head and tail of the spines of some late fifteenth and early sixteenth-century German bindings were also  given a decorative secondary sewing, which has sometimes led to their being described, wrongly, as endbands. In some Greek-style bindings, the decoration of the primary endband was carried out in two stages - a secondary sewing which consists often of a helix of thread wound around the primary endband, which then serves as the foundation for a decorative tertiary sewing. */

	/** Endbands that are attached to the spine of the bookblock by means of adhesive only. Stuck-on endbands will always have a strip of material, the stuck-on endband lining, which may be either single or folded, of which the edge, which projects beyond the end of the spine of the bookblock, may be decorated with thread, thong or paint. Stuck-on endbands may also have cores which can be laced into boards or covers. Their structural function is limited to that of a transverse spine lining, and the decoration is incidental to that function, being made possible only by their location. The joints of the stuck-on endband linings, which project beyond the width of the spine and which will be found on all examples until the mid-eighteenth century, were adhered to the outside of the boards up until the first half of the eighteenth century, after which they are more usually adhered to the inside of the boards. In this latter position, the projecting edges of the joints will often be trimmed back to the height of the bookblock. When worked with thread, the sewing follows the pattern of secondary endband sewing and the threads are not taken down into the gatherings, although it is also possible to find worked stuck-on endbands folded over cores where occasional tiedowns are taken down into the gatherings, thus forming a sort of hybrid endband (Szirmai, Fig. 9.30 (c)).
Stuck-on endbands are a German invention, and have been recorded from the mid-fifteenth century. They remained an exclusively Germanic practice (including Scandinavia, The Netherlands, Flemish-speaking Belgium and most of Eastern Europe) until the mid-eighteenth century, from which time examples of folded paper stuck-on endbands are found in most European countries except Britain, which seems only to have begun to use them in the early nineteenth century. */

	/** A vegetable-tanned skin, tanned with willow and other types of barks, then curried on the flesh side with birch bark extract which gave it its distinctive smell, emanating from Russia, mostly from the area around St-Petersburg.  It is usually coloured a dark reddish brown, and was made from the skins of a variety of animals, including horse, bovine calves and reindeer calves, though the name by which it is often known in English, ‘russia calf’, has led to an erroneous assumption that it is always bovine calf. The skins are usually taken from mature animals and are therefore relatively thick and best suited for bindings on large books. They were certainly used in the Low Countries by the mid-17th century and in England from c. 1700, and possibly earlier in eastern Europe, but were used throughout Europe for the rest of the century. They have generally proven to be extremely durable. Though possibly at first boarded in two directions to create a diamond-shaped grain, the hair sides of the skins were more usually diced with a lattice of single lines created by small tools such a ribbed rollers, which, because of the large size of the skins and the restricted width of the rollers, was somewhat irregular and did not form an even grid over large areas. This is one of the means by which genuine russia leather can be identified. It was perhaps because of this irregular appearance that some binders from as early as the mid-eighteenth century tooled a new grid of lines over the original that was regular and true to the rectangular shape of the boards, though the original dicing is usually still discernible underneath it. In the later eighteenth century, some European tanneries produced an inferior quality imitation russia leather that reveals itself by its rapid deterioration, in contrast to the greater durability of the genuine russia leather. */

	/** A feature of a structure sewn on four supports which are arranged in pairs towards the head and tail of the spine, leaving a wide space in the middle of the spine. It was developed as a structure which would allow three-on and even five-on sewing to remain viable by concentrating the structural elements of the sewing towards the head and tail of the spine, where the strength was most needed. The arrangement of the supports on the spine often resembles the spacing found on books sewn on five supports with the central support omitted, but the proportions can vary widely on different examples. Sewing &#039;wide in the middle&#039; was introduced in Britain in the last quarter of the eighteenth century for publishers&#039; or edition bindings covered in paper with uncut edges, also known as boarded bindings. It survived as a cheap structure for such bindings into the first quarter of the nineteenth century, but is occasionally encountered in leather-covered books in the early nineteenth century in both France and Britain. A similar phenomenon can be found in some late seventeenth century French bindings with the sewing supports spaced as for five raised sewing supports with the central support left out and replaced on the rounded and backed spines by a false bands. This appears to have been a simple economy measure, and was certainly used in Lyon if not elsewhere. */

The more tightly packed the supports are, the less flexible they become, and the process can be used to control the flexibility of the supports and thus the extent to which the spine will arch upwards as the bookblock is opened. It takes extra time when sewing a bookblock and thus adds to the cost of binding. Pack-sewing was commonly used throughout the medieval period, but was increasingly abandoned after the introduction of printing as a cost-cutting expedient and is seldom if ever found after the sixteenth century.

This took less time and allowed the thread to be tensioned at the change-over station at the end of each gathering rather than at each sewing support, as was necessary when passing the thread around the supports (wound sewing), further accelerating the process. In England, this technique came into use in the first half of the seventeenth century. A similar economy was also possible with flat sewing supports such as parchment and textile tapes, in which the thread passes across the back of the supports and not around them, leaving a gap in the thread which is the width of the sewing supports visible on the inside of the gatherings at each sewing support (also known as tape sewing, Etherington and Roberts). This has been recorded in England from as early as the first decade of the eighteenth century, but does not become common until the mid-century. */

	/** Narrow strips of sheet material, most often thin parchment and often obtained as waste from the leaves of medieval manuscripts, folded along their length, and either inserted into the centres of gatherings and sewn through to reinforce the spine folds of the gatherings or placed outside to reinforce the outside of the gatherings on the spine. Also known as sewing stays (Clarkson). Sewing guards were used on some early Coptic bindings with leaves of papyrus, but were introduced into western Europe at the same time as paper-leaved gatherings, as it was thought that paper alone would not be strong enough to prevent the sewing thread tearing through the gatherings of bound books with paper leaves. It was a time-consuming part of the binding process and was gradually abandoned in the last quarter of the fifteenth century as the quantities of printed books to be bound increased and it was realised that the reinforcements were not actually necessary. This process is evidenced in the reduction in the number of sewing guards found in a bookblock, from one in each gathering, as found typically up to the 1480s, to one or two at each end of the bookblock, even to just one at the beginning of the bookblock, by the end of the century. They appear to be rarely found in the sixteenth century.

This locks the thread around the tiedown and secures the endband core firmly to the back corner of the bookblock to which it has been sewn. Alternative methods of working an endband with a back bead are given in Giuffrida (1982) and Greenfield and Hille (1990) which use both ends of a single thread.

In addition, the covering material itself will also reinforce board attachment, but rarely, if ever, constitutes the primary board attachment.

	/** The term brocade paper is somewhat complicated as it covers a variety of different types of embossed decorated paper, many of which themselves use more than one decorative technique. It was developed in Augsburg at the end of the seventeenth century, at more or less the same time as bronze-varnish paper, and created the most expensive decorated papers of their time, which were sold all over Europe. The most commonly found type was created by metal-leaf embossing over an uncoloured or previously decorated paper, where metal leaf, therefore, only partially covers the surface. The paper, whether coloured or uncoloured, is first coated with some form of heat-set adhesive, covered with metal leaf, usually an alloy of a base metal, and then placed on a felt or a soft support. The paper is then embossed in a rolling press with heated engraved plates (usually made from a copper alloy, such as brass), which creates a slight relief in the paper and transfers a metallic decorative pattern or letters to the depressions in the embossed surface. The excess of metal is finally brushed off the paper to leave the metal leaf visible only in the depressed areas of the embossed design (created by the raised parts of the plates). The metal leaf was used either with a positive plate to create the elements of the design (when a motif such as a flower is in metal) or with a negative plate, in which the metal leaf becomes the background to a design which is revealed in the colour of the paper. The paper used prior to metal-leaf embossing could be uncoloured, already coloured (brush-colouring, engine-colouring, paste paper, etc.) or decorated with a variety of techniques including stencilling, hand-colouring, sprinkling etc.
A specific type of brocade paper, called drap d’or, was first coloured through stencils, then metal-leaf embossed and finally coloured by hand afterwards in specific areas of the design (hand-colouring), in order to enhance parts of the decoration (e.g. petals or flower leaves).
A very rare type of decorated paper was created by blind-embossing a metallic paper, which was therefore already entirely covered with metal leaf and blind-embossed, before being decorated by hand with coloured paint. Because it is coloured as well as embossed with the same type of plate used for brocade paper, these papers can also be described as brocade papers.

By extension, therefore, many blue papers as well as drab papers manufactured in other mills have sometimes been called Cobb papers, even though there is seldom any evidence that he made them. If his name is to be used to describe such papers, they should be described as ‘Cobb-type papers’. In bookbinding, these papers were extensively used during the first half of the 19th century, if not earlier, both as a covering material and as endleaves  */

	/** A pulp-colouring process in which the paper is coloured all the way through its thickness, which is produced from using beaten coloured textile fibres as paper pulp. The most common source of coloured textile was blue, as blue rags were readily available, but could not be used to make white paper. Many blue papers from at least the late seventeenth century onwards were made this way, and can be identified under high magnification by the predominant presence of blue fibres in the paper, often of several different shades of blue, and mixed with white fibres in different quantities to create paler or darker blue papers. */

Primary endband sewing must by definition be entirely separate from the sewing of the bookblock. Endbands in the medieval period and well into the 16th century in some parts of Europe will be found with tiedowns in every gathering, but increasingly the number of tiedowns was reduced as a form of economy.

	/** The word ‘doublure’, a French word meaning a lining, which has been used rather indiscriminately of almost any decorated material on the inside of the boards of a book, is problematic in the description of a binding, as although it is often used, it has been used to mean a variety of different components and it does not in itself define a binding component so much as a rather vague concept, different manifestations of which can be found in the same place, i.e. on the inside of the boards of a binding. They may be endleaves used as pastedowns, even if made of tanned skin and often, but not always, decorated with tooling, or separate pastedowns (which might be described as linings) or even comb lining extensions cut to extend across the full width of the board. However they are made, the word is frequently used to imply a degree of applied decoration on the material used or the use of an exotic material such as watered or decorated silk, snake-skin, etc. How much decoration and what type of material is required to turn a pastedown into a ‘doublure’ is an open question, and it can be argued that it is therefore best to restrict a description to the technical facts (‘pastedown of tanned skin with gold-tooled borders’, ‘separate pastedown of watered silk with a joint of tanned skin’, ‘full-width comb-lining extension of red, tanned goatskin with a gold-tooled border frame’, etc.) rather than take a chance on the word ‘doublure’, the chance lying in whether both the writer and reader of a description will have the same definition in mind.

German examples have been identified from the second half of the eighteenth-century and very occasionally in England at the end of the eighteenth century.

Even though they may appear superficially to be the same, in that adhesive alone is used to attach the boards and cover to the bookblock, the latter is an inboard structure.

	/** Boards in which pieces of a previously-manufactured sheet material are held together with an adhesive. Such boards were from an early date also known as pasteboards, but this term has traditionally been used almost exclusively of boards made from paper, and within that category, has been used rather indiscriminately of different types of paper board and cannot be relied on to denote exclusively this type of board manufacture. Adhesive laminates have also been made from parchment, leather, tawed skin, textile, papyrus and hemp fibre as well as paper (or combinations of these), and had the advantage for the binder both of allowing for any thickness of board, depending on the number of laminations used and of being able to be made in the binder&#039;s workshop rather than bought from specialist board manufacturers. They could also be used effectively at a thinness at which wooden boards became too brittle to use safely. Adhesive-laminate boards using sheets of parchment are known in western Europe from as early as the twelfth century, but the use of paper is particularly associated with the Islamic world and for this reason early western European examples mostly come from Spain. By the mid-fifteenth century, however, paper adhesive-laminate boards became increasingly popular in Italy and from there spread northwards until, by the first quarter of the sixteenth century, they can be found in all western European countries (Hobson, Humanists, Appendix 1). They can often be distinguished from couched-laminate boards where damaged corners are visible.

It is associated with books sewn on recessed supports with smooth spines, which, because of the comparative thinness of recessed supports, have more flexible spines which are therefore more likely to have this damaging effect on gold-tooled spines.

Bypass sewing has been recorded on a French inboard binding of the second decade of the sixteenth century, but does not become common until the 1550s (Pickwoad Onwards). After that time they come into widespread use across Europe, often, from the seventeenth century, in combination with multi-section sewing. */

On the fore-edge of a book with two fastening, the centre bevel will stop short of the fastening attachment sites. The short bevels found above and below the fastenings are called clasp bevels to differentiate them from centre bevels. Centre bevels are commonly found on German bindings from the late fifteenth century, and were subsequently used across northern Europe, though they do not appear to have been used in southern Europe. They are likely to be found only on wooden boards, though some pastiche antiquarian bindings in Britain of the early nineteenth century created rather exaggerated versions of centre chamfers in couched-laminate boards. Their widespread popularity in German-speaking countries led, in the eighteenth century, to the covering skins on flat board surfaces being tooled with fillets in blind in imitation of centre bevels. Boards with centre bevel on the internal surface will usually have much longer bevels leaving only a short length of square edge at each end. These edges were popular in Italy circa 1500. */

The protective function of chemises made from plain alum-tawed skin (a typical Romanesque type, but found throughout the middle-ages) was often subsumed into decoration by the use of exotic and expensive silk textiles, worked with metal threads in silver and gold and with elaborate tassels on the corners, intended to show the wealth and taste of the owner. It is this latter type which is most often known as a chemise. The characteristic knotted cover of the girdle-book was sometimes formed by a secondary cover or chemise, often of leather, the skirt of which was gathered together in an elaborate knot or decorated ring which allowed it to hang from a belt, or girdle (Szirmai, p.236-7).

He was undoubtedly not the first binder to do this (the technique was known from the middle-ages), and although his name is firmly attached to this type of edge treatment, it is anachronistic to use it of bindings made before the nineteenth century, and has little meaning in languages other than English.

Cover linings are a French phenomenon and first appear in the last quarter of the 16th century. Early in the 17th century, French binders simplified the structure by folding the parchment cover over the cover lining and attaching both at the same time by means of the endband slips, without lacing the sewing support slips through the cover lining (the slips were usually cut off at the joints).

	/** There are two types of cover which may typically be found on a book, primary and secondary. The primary cover is the material that constitutes the immediate covering of the completed binding, but not including additional, secondary, covers such as chemises or decorated paper over a plain primary cover. For inboard bindings, the primary covering material is used to cover the boards and spine, either completely, as in full bindings, or partially, as in half and quarter bindings. In all case bindings, and bindings with external sewing supports and longstitch bindings, the case itself may also be the covering material, and thus serve a dual function as both primary covering (which therefore may be given a secondary, decorated cover) and structural component. A secondary cover can be added in addition to a primary cover (but cannot be a secondary cover unless there is a primary cover already in place), either as protection or further embellishment of the book. In the latter case they are often made from decorated materials (most often textile or paper), but purely protective secondary covers can be made made from plain materials such as tanned or alum-tawed skins or paper, or recycled paper or parchment. They may be contemporary with and part of a complete binding, or may have been added afterwards (sometimes many years afterwards) to suit the taste and needs of a later owner. Many bindings with primary covers in parchment also have a lining of white paper under the parchment, intended both to brighten the parchment and make it opaque and also to soften the parchment with the moisture from the adhesive used to stick together so that it could be moulded around the book. Such linings on Dutch laced-case bindings with boards were adhered to the fleshside of the parchment before the book was covered, and could not be described as primary covers, but linings on Dutch inboard bindings of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were usually adhered to the book before the parchment was adhered around it. Such lining could therefore be thought of as primary covers, but their intended use as a lining and the fact that they would never have been left as covers in themselves means that they should always be thought of as a lining of the primary cover and not as an actual primary cover. Some bindings with embroidered covers may have similar linings. */

	/** A bookblock with laced-on boards made of paper which were cut at head and tail with the boards whilst preserving squares on the boards at both edges. This was made possible because the lacing allowed the board to be moved a short distance up and down the joints. If, therefore, the boards were both pushed as far as they would towards one end of the bookblock and the other end was then cut with the boards, when the boards were returned to their original position, they would project beyond the cut edge of the bookblock. The process could then be repeated for the other end. The process had the advantage that the edges of the boards would always be exactly parallel to the edges of the bookblock. The process can be recognised if an exposed head or tail edge of one of the boards has on it the same decoration as the corresponding bookblock edge, as the edges were often decorated as soon as they were cut and while they were still in the cutting press. The fore-edges of the boards would be cut individually and not with the fore-edge, which would be cut on its own with the assistance of a trindle. Fore-edges of books with rounded spines (and therefore rounded fore-edges) were not usually coloured in the press, as the whiteness on the surfaces of the leaves along their edges would show when the round shape was returned the bookblock after it was released from the laying press and the trindles were removed. The edge would be coloured after this, and if the boards were closed, the colour will be found on the fore-edge squares of the boards and not on their edges.

	/** Endleaves are all the groups of leaves of a variety of sheet materials found at each side of a bookblock and are intended to give protection to the text leaves. They come in two basic types: those added by the binder before the book is sewn (separate endleaves) and blank leaves at the front and/or the back of the textblock (integral endleaves) which are used as endleaves, and may or may not also be pasted to the boards as pastedowns, even though they form part of text gatherings. Separate endleaves and integral endleaves can be combined at either the left or right ends of the textblock, and the endleaves at left and right can be made up differently. This is often the case in printed books where the printed text supplies blank leaves at either end of the textblock, allowing the binder to leave out the same number of added leaves, but have the same number of endleaves at each end of the bookblock. In some student books and other working copies of books, gatherings of blank paper were added to the end of the textblock for writing on, and it is sometimes hard to make a distinction between these and endleaves, especially when the final leaf of the final gathering is used as a pastedown, and a careful description will be necessary. When describing a book, endleaves are normally found on either side of the textblock.  Endleaves may serve either as pastedowns or free endleaves, depending on whether or not they are pasted to the inside of a board or cover. For reasons of economy, binders would often chose paper that, when folded into endleaves, was somewhat smaller than the dimensions of the textblock (undersize endleaves). In other cases, they might use paper of the same size as the textblock (same-size endleaves) or, much less frequently, larger (oversize endleaves). */

	/** Skins from animals in the Caprinae subfamily to which goat and sheep both belong. The goat is an animal with a coat of coarse hair that leaves clearly defined hair follicles in the skin, grouped in three in waving lines across the skin, usually in combination with a rich, deep grain. The best quality skins have a dense network of fibres in the epidermis, which, in combination with stable organic tanning agents such a sumac, produced skins of great beauty with outstanding durability. The best skins were imported (hence the names they were given in Europe – maroquin, turkey leather and today niger – named after the countries they came from. The sheep is a closely related animal which, depending on the proportion of coarse hairs and fine wool hairs in the skin will look more or less like goatskin, and if there is a very high proportion of coarse hair (hairsheep), the skin is, to the eye, more or less indistinguishable from goatskin. This confusion was compounded in the early eighteenth century when Edward Harley, Earl of Oxford, unable to obtain sufficient quantities of high-quality turkey leather (tanned goatskin) for his enormous library, began to import a bright red skin directly from Morocco made from the skins of hairsheep. Because of where it came from, it was called ‘morocco leather’, which means that English and French morocco leather came from different animals – with vastly different levels of durability, to which the deterioriated condition of many of Lord Harley’s morocco-covered books will testify. While the true, high-quality tanned goatskins are usually readily identifiable, the difficulty in distinguishing hairsheep from poorer quality goatskin, especially when made into parchment, means that it may be best to describe these skins as caprinae, knowing that the skin lies somewhere within this spectrum of the animal kingdom, but without having to be too specific. The many bindings covered in brown, tanned sheepskin found on cheap editions such as schoolbooks in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries have clearly visible hair follicles, and are clearly not goatskin, but the brightly coloured skins of hairsheep have often been mistaken for goatskin. If it is not possible to identify the animal precisely, it is better to hedge your bets. */

It may appear difficult to decide whether blank text leaves (text blanks) at one or other end of a textblock should be considered as endleaves. However, if a text blank has been pasted to the inside of a board or cover as a pastedown or if there are separate endleaves only at the other end of the textblock, the text blanks may with confidence be described as integral endleaves.

	/** The process by which a case cover is attached to the bookblock by means of sewing the gatherings to the cover through pairs of holes between which the thread is visible on the spine of the cover, creating one or more longstitch sets, though the threads are often hidden by a secondary cover. Properly speaking, such a structure should be called &#039;longsewing&#039;, but the term longstitch, deriving from the German &#039;langstich&#039;, is so deeply embedded in the literature as to be inextricable. The cover was usually trimmed at the same time as the head, tail and fore-edges of the bookblock were cut, with the result that the cover and the bookblock are of the same height and width, and the cover has neither squares nor turn-ins. Covers can be made with turn-ins, but for this to work, the edges of the bookblock must either be left uncut, or be cut before the book is sewn. Because the cover is attached to the bookblock as the book is sewn, the structure has to be non-adhesive and cannot have any spine linings. The longstitch structure was used in Middle Ages for blank-book or stationery bindings, and the structure was transferred to printed books in Italy as early as the 1480s, as it provided an inexpensive and convenient way to protect and hold together books as they moved through the booktrade to their first owners. Although it is to be presumed that many longstitch bindings will have been rebound by later owners, and the covers therefore lost, the versatility of the structure and its ease of use by readers has meant the many examples have survived. Because of its low cost, it became increasingly associated with inexpensive books such as guide books, popular devotional literature, romances, play-texts and opera libretti, though its ease of opening and flexibility, the consequences of its non-adhesive spine, made it also suitable for music books, as the pages would lie open without trouble at any opening, a necessary virtue for use by a musician. Although very common in Italy, they are also found in the Low Countries and in Germany, in which latter country they seem to have been popular as bindings for student texts. In the Low Countries the structure survived into the twentieth century on almanacs, a testament to the practical virtues of the structure. */

Outside hooks can be found used on their own, in multiples or as one of several components within a single endleaf unit. A common type consists of a single piece of sheet material folded in half and then folded again along the folded edge to create a folded stub. Because this format does not allow the inside of the folded stub to be pasted, this type is rarely used as a pastedown. Outside hook endleaves were in regular use across Europe from the second half of the sixteenth and right through seventeenth century. They survived well into the eighteenth century, but were less popular in Britain than on the continent of Europe from the mid-seventeenth century. A popular continental variation was to use a sheet of decorated paper folded within a sheet of plain paper, and then to use the decorated paper as a pastedown. Where the outer full leaf is used as a pastedown (pasted on top of the stub or stubs), they can be a little difficult to recognise, but in almost all cases the sewing thread will be seen to tear though the fold along the spine edge of the pastedown, thus revealing their construction. */

When used on an edge under heavy pressure in a laying or cutting press, a well-set-up plough with a properly sharpened blade is unlikely to leave any marks on the edge, but the area of the head- and tail edges of a bookblock close to the spine could not be heavily compressed because of the swelling caused by the sewing thread. The plough blade was therefore likely to leave parallel marks in this slightly spongy area of the bookblock as it was passed backwards and forwards over the edge. When the bookblock expanded slightly as it was taken out of the press and perhaps had the spine reshaped for the attachment of boards, the straight, parallel plough marks would become curved, often in a pattern of parallel, curved lines converging towards the centre of the spine. The distance between each line will indicate the width of each cut by the plough.

	/** The first, and often only, cover on a binding, and which could serve as the finished external surface of the binding. The term is used to distinguish the covering first put onto the book before the addition of a secondary cover. It is not possible to have a secondary cover unless there is already a primary cover, and the primary cover will always cover at least the spine and the spine-edges of the boards if not the whole book. On some medieval bindings it is possible to have a full secondary cover over a quarter primary cover, resulting in a binding in which the secondary cover will be in direct contact with the larger part of the boards. This does not make it a primary cover, as the quarter spine covering will always have been there first. Where case covers are concerned, the primary cover may stand alone. A primary covering may take the form of a part cover and therefore be made of one or more different materials. Case covers present a more complex problem of definition, in that the primary cover of laced-case binding, one-piece case binding or longstitch binding through a full cover is the case cover itself. Any decorated paper subsequently wrapped around them is therefore a secondary cover. If an adhesive case cover is made in the German manner as a three-piece case cover, it must, by analogy, constitute the primary cover and the decorated paper often added to them would also be a secondary cover. However, in the type of case developed in the 1820s, in which the boards and spine inlay were held together by their covering (usually of bookcloth), the separate boards and spine inlay cannot really be thought of as a cover in themselves (unlike the German three-piece case which, although made of three separate components, is attached to a bookblock as a single unit). It would seem, therefore, sensible for the components which make up a full case cover (i.e. one which reaches around the spine from fore-edge to fore-edge) to be regarded as a primary cover from the moment when they are joined together as a single unit. Any subsequent covering should be thought of as a secondary covering. A longstitch guard, therefore, because it does not extend to the fore-edges of a bookblock, does not constitute a primary cover, which role is taken by the full cover which was folded over it. */

Where a cover is attached to a previously- and independently-sewn bookblock by tackets, the tackets should be called secondary tackets. The simplicity and speed of execution of primary tacketing made it useful as a provisional structure, used perhaps to hold gatherings together during the writing and assembly of hand-written manuscripts (see quire tackets), prior to binding the gatherings together in a more complex structure.

	/** A board material made in single thick sheets from coarsely pulped paper, typically acquired from the trimmings from the cut edges of bookblocks, waste printed or manuscript paper, etc. When it breaks down at broken corners, it will not divide into layers but into very uneven flake-like fragments of paper. Pulp boards were made in a variety of thicknesses, and thinner boards were often laminated together with an adhesive to build up the thickness for larger books. The pulp appears to have been formed into sheets over a woven screen, the impression of which is therefore found on one side of the board. These screens appear to have been made of a textile, often of a very coarse weave, not unlike sacking. Careful binders made sure that the screen-side of the board was placed against the bookblock, so as not to show through a leather cover. Pulp boards are typical of British binding from the last quarter of the sixteenth century through to the third quarter of the seventeenth century, after which they become increasingly rare, except for the cheapest books, on which they may occasionally be found up until the early nineteenth century. They do not appear to have been much used on the continent of Europe. They were made both by professional suppliers of board and, from the appearance of tubs and moulds in inventories of binders&#039; workshops (Strickland Gibson, 1907), sometimes by the binders themselves, who would collect edge trimmings from books they bound and other waste material in a waste bin (often the tub under the laying press) in their workshops for this purpose. As a result, small bits of other types of material, including textile, thread, parchment, quill trimmings, fragments of wood, metal pins, etc., may be found in the boards (Middleton). */

	/** Quarter covers are those which cover only the spine and the back edge of the boards. Books with quarter covers are also known as &#039;quarter bindings&#039;, sometimes qualified by the covering material on the spine, as in quarter calf. The proportion of the boards that they cover varies enormously according to where and when the books may have been bound, but the most common proportion is from about one eighth to one quarter of the board (the name presumably coming from the latter proportion). The term is problematic when applied to fifteenth-century German examples where the covering material may extend to over half of the width of the board, at which point the term &#039;quarter&#039; seems inadequate. It is, however, such a firmly established term that it is not likely that it can be changed. Instead, a qualifying measurement of the proportion of the board covered in such books may need to be added where a more precise definition is required, as in &quot;a quarter (55%) binding&quot;. The primary reason for the use of quarter covers was economy, and they are often found on bindings with other indicators of low-cost in terms of structural short-cuts and inexpensive materials. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they were also used, together with half covers to show off expensive materials on the spines of books shelved vertically with their spines outwards, in the modern manner. Quarter covers are commonly found on south German and north Italian bindings in the second half of the fifteenth and first half of the sixteenth centuries, typically used with wooden boards which remained uncovered, though in some German examples, the exposed wooden boards were sometimes decorated with blind-tooled fillets. In the sixteenth century, German binders often continued to use quarter covers of tanned or alum-tawed skin over paper boards or scaleboards, which were covered before the quarter spines were put onto the book. Any of the conventional covering materials might be used to make quarter covers, and they are found on a variety of different structures, both as primary covers and secondary covers. Unexpected combinations of materials can be found on English bindings of the late eighteenth century, such as tanned goat-skin, parchment or russia leather on the spines with marbled calf leather on the sides. Such bindings need to be carefully distinguished from those with full covers of one material and onlays on the spine of a different material, such as a high-quality tanned goatskin onlay over a full cover of calf leather. Quarter covers of leather with a plated straight-grain pattern and sides with the same straight-grain pattern and often of the same colour were popular in France in the first quarter of the nineteenth century. Somewhat confusingly, quarter bindings were often described in the 18th century as &#039;half bindings&#039;, and care must be taken when reading such descriptions to work out exactly what is meant.  */

	/** Scaleboard (or sca&#039;board) is a thin board most often split from blocks of wood with a metal froe. Scaleboards, which had many other commercial and domestic uses, could also be made by planing thin sheets off larger pieces of wood, but it is not known how wide or thick such planed sheets could be.  In European bookbinding, sca&#039;boards were most often obtained from beech, whose fine, straight grain made it most suitable for this purpose. It differs from the thicker, cleft planks also obtained by splitting timber in that it is much thinner, ranging from approximately 3mm down to less than 1mm. At such thicknesses, the wood is easily broken and it was therefore sometimes laminated to or between pieces of paper board. It was used most often on small-format books in cheap bindings, such as school books and inexpensive devotional literature from at least the mid-sixteenth century. It was seen to be an inferior quality material, presumably on account of its brittleness, and attempts were made in England in the sixteenth century to prevent its use. It was in much more common use in Germany, but was used to varying extents in all western-European countries. In an apparent contradiction of preferred practice, some binders, most notably in New England, but also in Germany, used sca&#039;boards with a horizontal grain, to reduce the likelihood of the boards breaking along the grain by having one end-grain edge of each board braced against the joint of the bookblock. */

Many plain laced or adhesive cases of cartonnage were originally given secondary covers of decorated paper, but all other types of binding could be given secondary covers, either by professional bookbinders or by their owners at any time after they were made.

	/** Sewing stations are created by passing a thread through a spine fold when sewing a book. Each sewing support will therefore correspond to a sewing station. Sewing stations include change-over stations or chain-stitch stations in an unsupported structure. Some broad sewing supports have a sewing hole on each side of them and these should count as a single sewing station with two holes (two-hole sewing station). Very occasionally, three-hole stations may be encountered. In a structure with sewing supports there will usually be a change-over station above and below the supported area of the spine, thus adding two extra stations to the number of sewing supports. If there are no separate change-over stations, the number of sewing stations will be the same as the number of sewing supports. In some German bindings with Kapitalbünde, the binders worked chainstitches across the spine between the Kapitalbünde and the closest sewing supports, thus creating two additional stations. In some English bindings of the second half of the seventeenth century with bookblocks sewn on recessed sewing supports, additional recesses were cut across the spine between the sewing supports and sometimes also at head and tail close to the change-over stations to allow the spine adhesive to penetrate to the inner bifolia of the gatherings in order to reinforce multi-section sewing and the often rather weak structures found on such books. The term sewing station has been used by some writers to include only those stations where there are sewing supports and not to include the change-over stations, but this would mean that unsupported sewing structures would have no sewing stations at all, which is clearly not the case. Sewing stations can either be made as a book is sewn by pushing a needle through the spine folds of otherwise unmarked gatherings, or they can be prepared in advance of sewing (marking up), which will result in neater, faster and more regular sewing. Different methods were used to do this. */

	/** A somewhat obscure and ambiguous term which seems to have been used, at different times, for very different materials. The word, along with its French and German equivalent, chagrin, is said to have been derived from the Persian expression saghari, which applies to a leather produced from an ass, and which had an indented grain surface caused by spreading seeds of Chenopodium (goose foot) over the surface of the moist skin, covering the skin with a cloth, and trampling them into the skin. When the skin was dry the seeds were shaken off, leaving the surface of the leather covered with small indentations. In the 17th and early 18th centuries, however, the term &quot;shagreen&quot; (or &quot;chagrin&quot;) began to be applied to a leather made from sharkskin having a curious grain surface of lonzenge-shaped, raised and spiny scales of minute size, the character of which is difficult to perceive without optical assistance. This material will most often be found on almanacs and liturgica, without gold-tooling and often with silver, furniture and clasps. The term was also applied to the skin of a rayfish (probably Hypolophus sephen), which is covered with round, closely set, calcified papillae resembling small pearls. In its natural form it has been used for many years in both the East and the West for a variety of purposes, including bookbinding; however, in the early years of the 18th century it became the practice to grind the surface flat and smooth, leaving only the pattern of small contiguous circles. The skins prepared in this way are more likely to be found covering small boxes, instrument cases, etuis, etc. than books on which the material appears to be used very rarely. This is the skin which for a century has been called &quot;shagreen&quot;; how confusion arose with sharkskin, which is completely different both in character and in appearance, is not clear. */

	/** The projections of a board beyond the head-, tail-, and fore-edges of a bookblock are called squares. The origin of the term is not recorded, but a medium square may be taken as a projection which is equal to the thickness of the board. Below this measurement, the squares can be described as narrow and beyond it, as wide. Measuring the width of squares is not always easy, as bookblocks which have dropped between their boards because of vertical storage will give false measurements, and the binders of cheaper books often took little trouble either to cut the board edges parallel to the bookblock or even to cut them straight. An approximate assessment relative to the size of the bookblock is often therefore the most satisfactory. It may also be found that the squares are not of equal width on each edge, often leaving the fore-edge noticeably wider than the head- and tail-edges, but also, on occasion, with unequal squares at head and tail. The boards may also be cut to the size of the bookblock, cut flush together with the edges of the bookblock, or, in the case of Greek bindings, the bookblock may be cut level with the boards after it has been sewn to the boards. In all these cases, there will be no squares. On rare occasions, boards may be cut smaller than the bookblock (undersize), most often where the bookblock is uncut and retains its deckle edges. Care must be taken, however, not to mistake unequal squares on wooden boards which are the result of the subsequent shrinking of the wood across the grain with unequal squares which were intended by the binder. In bindings with squares this can result in boards without squares on the fore-edge (if the grain direction of the wooden board is vertical) and in bindings originally without squares, it can result in the wooden boards drawing back several millimetres from the edges of the bookblock. Boards made from paper are not liable to this type of shrinkage. However, the paper boards used in parchment-covered laced-case bindings with boards were cut without squares on the fore-edge if the cover was to have cover extensions, whilst retaining squares at head and tail.  The definition of squares given above works only for boards, but for limp covers of paper or parchment, the term &#039;squares&#039; is not particularly useful, as the thickness of the cover is almost always going to be narrower than the projection of the cover beyond the bookblock. Measurements are not necessarily useful as the width may vary within each side of the cover, let alone between the two sides. Identifying only those which are flush, or unusually narrow or wide is perhaps the most practical way of dealing with this question. */

This meant that it was possible to have a thinner flexible spine-piece that allowed the book to open whilst having a rigid board on each side to support and protect the bookblock, a dual function that was not possible with the one-piece case. The three-piece case was known in France at the end of the eighteenth century as the ‘reliure Bradel’ or ‘cartonnage à la Bradel’ having been introduced there, apparently, by a member of the Bradel family. */

	/** A strip of sheet material usually placed across the panel formed between two sewing stations, and occasionally over an individual sewing support, and which extends beyond on both sides the width of the spine, to form lining extensions at each end. Panel transverse linings are almost always found only on bindings with raised sewing supports, with one lining to each panel, whereas sewing support transverse linings will only be found on bindings with recessed sewing supports. On some bindings with widely-spaced sewing supports they can be found used in pairs in which case each should be described separately as they may be made from different materials. The panel transverse lining is one of the most common types of spine lining, and was used in all European countries from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century, though it was much less commonly used in France and Britain than elsewhere, even allowing for a general reluctance in Britain to use spine linings at all. There is a marked difference in the height of the linings within the panels formed by the sewing supports between northern and southern Europe. South of the Alps and in Spain, the linings will generally fill the entire height of the panels in which they are found (full-height transverse spine linings), whereas in Germany and the Low Countries, they are more likely to be much narrower, often filling less than 50% of the height of the panel (narrow transverse spine linings). */

Wooden nails were not affected by the corrosive salts in alum-tawed skin and therefore work well with this material. They were commonly used in Italian bindings, where the lacing path (a tunnel in the spine edge of the board leading into an external channel) required nails to prevent the slips pulling out of the boards, until replaced by metal nails at the end of the fifteenth century.

	/** Process of decorating sheets of paper or other sheet materials by transferring colours floating on the surface of a size to the sheets by laying them directly onto the colours. In a flat trough filled with water and a surface-tension medium like gum tragacanth, liquid colours are sprinkled on the surface using various brushes and then manipulated into the desired arrangement on the surface of the size. A sheet of paper is then directly laid onto the colours to transfer them to the paper. Each sheet is thus unique, as although the same basic design may be copied, there will always be differences. The liquid colours are sprinkled on the surface of the size using various brushes and successively shaped into patterns drawn with points, rakes (or ‘combs’), or dropped one after the other to create more random patterns. Once the desired pattern is achieved in the trough, a sheet of paper (usually blank but sometimes already marbled with another design) is laid on the surface of the size, where the design is permanently transferred to the paper by absorption, and then lifted up, after which it is hung up to dry. When dry, the decorated paper can finally be burnished to produce an attractive gloss and to seal the surface of the colours. This technique can also be applied to decorate book edges, by dipping the edges of a firmly-compressed book one after the other into the trough to pick up the colours . */

	/** The name given to the high-quality sumac-tanned goatskins imported into England probably from sub-Saharan Africa. They got their name from being imported through Smyrna (modern Izmir) in Turkey, while what appear to be identical skins were known in France as maroquin, as they were imported into France from Morocco. The skins imported into England directly from Morocco for Lord Harley’s library in the early 18th century, and known in England as morocco leather, were taken from hairsheep and are of inferior quality. The distinction between turkey leather and morocco leather was maintained within the booktrade until the last quarter of the eighteenth century, when the English term morocco began to be applied to the same sumac-tanned African goatskins that had been called turkey leather up to that point, and this is now the general modern usage. The confusion resulting from this can be reduced either by using the French word for the skins used in France (maroquin) or by qualifying the word morocco as French morocco where relevant. Where it is possible to distinguish them, the simplest answer is to refer to the higher-quality skins as tanned goatskin, but the terminological distinction between Turkey leather and Lord Harley&#039;s (i.e. hairsheep) morocco leather is as complex as identifying the skins themselves can often be, especially as so many bindings described as &#039;morocco bindings&#039; in library and booksellers&#039; catalogues from the nineteenth century onwards may or may not actually be covered in goatskin (see the entry under &#039;goat-sheep (caprinae skins)&#039;. */

A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. It may be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation.
It is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.

Secondary sewing could be very elaborate, worked in silk (perceived as a less durable material and seldom used for primary sewing until the seventeenth century), and include crowning cores, gold and silver threads and elaborate plaiting in coloured tanned or alum-tawed skin. The working in thread of worked stuck-on endbands should also be described as secondary sewing, for although there is no primary sewing, the endband is attached to the bookblock by adhesive, and the working in thread, which does not penetrate the text gatherings, is exactly the same as the secondary sewing on a worked endband. Some of the single sewing supports, or Kapitalbünde, found at the head and tail of the spines of some late fifteenth and early sixteenth-century German bindings were also  given a decorative secondary sewing, which has sometimes led to their being described, wrongly, as endbands. In some Greek-style bindings, the decoration of the primary endband was carried out in two stages - a secondary sewing which consists often of a helix of thread wound around the primary endband, which then serves as the foundation for a decorative tertiary sewing. */

Stuck-on endbands will always have a strip of material, the stuck-on endband lining, which may be either single or folded, of which the edge, which projects beyond the end of the spine of the bookblock, may be decorated with thread, thong or paint. Stuck-on endbands may also have cores which can be laced into boards or covers. Their structural function is limited to that of a transverse spine lining, and the decoration is incidental to that function, being made possible only by their location. The joints of the stuck-on endband linings, which project beyond the width of the spine and which will be found on all examples until the mid-eighteenth century, were adhered to the outside of the boards up until the first half of the eighteenth century, after which they are more usually adhered to the inside of the boards. In this latter position, the projecting edges of the joints will often be trimmed back to the height of the bookblock. When worked with thread, the sewing follows the pattern of secondary endband sewing and the threads are not taken down into the gatherings, although it is also possible to find worked stuck-on endbands folded over cores where occasional tiedowns are taken down into the gatherings, thus forming a sort of hybrid endband (Szirmai, Fig. 9.30 (c)).
Stuck-on endbands are a German invention, and have been recorded from the mid-fifteenth century. They remained an exclusively Germanic practice (including Scandinavia, The Netherlands, Flemish-speaking Belgium and most of Eastern Europe) until the mid-eighteenth century, from which time examples of folded paper stuck-on endbands are found in most European countries except Britain, which seems only to have begun to use them in the early nineteenth century. */

	/** A vegetable-tanned skin, tanned with willow and other types of barks, then curried on the flesh side with birch bark extract which gave it its distinctive smell, emanating from Russia, mostly from the area around St-Petersburg.  It is usually coloured a dark reddish brown, and was made from the skins of a variety of animals, including horse, bovine calves and reindeer calves, though the name by which it is often known in English, ‘russia calf’, has led to an erroneous assumption that it is always bovine calf. The skins are usually taken from mature animals and are therefore relatively thick and best suited for bindings on large books. They were certainly used in the Low Countries by the mid-17th century and in England from c. 1700, and possibly earlier in eastern Europe, but were used throughout Europe for the rest of the century. They have generally proven to be extremely durable. Though possibly at first boarded in two directions to create a diamond-shaped grain, the hair sides of the skins were more usually diced with a lattice of single lines created by small tools such a ribbed rollers, which, because of the large size of the skins and the restricted width of the rollers, was somewhat irregular and did not form an even grid over large areas. This is one of the means by which genuine russia leather can be identified. It was perhaps because of this irregular appearance that some binders from as early as the mid-eighteenth century tooled a new grid of lines over the original that was regular and true to the rectangular shape of the boards, though the original dicing is usually still discernible underneath it. In the later eighteenth century, some European tanneries produced an inferior quality imitation russia leather that reveals itself by its rapid deterioration, in contrast to the greater durability of the genuine russia leather. */

Because of their durability, uniformity, beauty, and form, grain patterns represent one of the most appealing and highly prized characteristics of leather, and it is for this reason that imitation grains are often embossed on inferior quality leathers and even printed or embossed on other materials, such as cloth or paper. */

	/** Pack-sewing consists of adding one or more extra turns of thread around the sewing supports (or endband cores) when sewing a gathering, to fill in the gaps that can be left on the supports between the gatherings. The more tightly packed the supports are, the less flexible they become, and the process can be used to control the flexibility of the supports and thus the extent to which the spine will arch upwards as the bookblock is opened. It takes extra time when sewing a bookblock and thus adds to the cost of binding. Pack-sewing was commonly used throughout the medieval period, but was increasingly abandoned after the introduction of printing as a cost-cutting expedient and is seldom if ever found after the sixteenth century.

The only country to do both on a regular basis is Italy, where a small proportion of books fasten from right to left, possibly bound in the very north of the country, where German is still spoken. Some binders would reverse their normal direction of fastening when binding books printed or written in languages that read from right to left (e.g. Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, etc.).

This took less time and allowed the thread to be tensioned at the change-over station at the end of each gathering rather than at each sewing support, as was necessary when passing the thread around the supports (wound sewing), further accelerating the process. In England, this technique came into use in the first half of the seventeenth century. A similar economy was also possible with flat sewing supports such as parchment and textile tapes, in which the thread passes across the back of the supports and not around them, leaving a gap in the thread which is the width of the sewing supports visible on the inside of the gatherings at each sewing support (also known as tape sewing, Etherington and Roberts).

Also known as sewing stays (Clarkson). Sewing guards were used on some early Coptic bindings with leaves of papyrus, but were introduced into western Europe at the same time as paper-leaved gatherings, as it was thought that paper alone would not be strong enough to prevent the sewing thread tearing through the gatherings of bound books with paper leaves. It was a time-consuming part of the binding process and was gradually abandoned in the last quarter of the fifteenth century as the quantities of printed books to be bound increased and it was realised that the reinforcements were not actually necessary. This process is evidenced in the reduction in the number of sewing guards found in a bookblock, from one in each gathering, as found typically up to the 1480s, to one or two at each end of the bookblock, even to just one at the beginning of the bookblock, by the end of the century.

This locks the thread around the tiedown and secures the endband core firmly to the back corner of the bookblock to which it has been sewn. Alternative methods of working an endband with a back bead are given in Giuffrida (1982) and Greenfield and Hille (1990) which use both ends of a single thread.

	/** The term brocade paper is somewhat complicated as it covers a variety of different types of embossed decorated paper, many of which themselves use more than one decorative technique. It was developed in Augsburg at the end of the seventeenth century, at more or less the same time as bronze-varnish paper, and created the most expensive decorated papers of their time, which were sold all over Europe. The most commonly found type was created by metal-leaf embossing over an uncoloured or previously decorated paper, where metal leaf, therefore, only partially covers the surface. The paper, whether coloured or uncoloured, is first coated with some form of heat-set adhesive, covered with metal leaf, usually an alloy of a base metal, and then placed on a felt or a soft support. The paper is then embossed in a rolling press with heated engraved plates (usually made from a copper alloy, such as brass), which creates a slight relief in the paper and transfers a metallic decorative pattern or letters to the depressions in the embossed surface. The excess of metal is finally brushed off the paper to leave the metal leaf visible only in the depressed areas of the embossed design (created by the raised parts of the plates). The metal leaf was used either with a positive plate to create the elements of the design (when a motif such as a flower is in metal) or with a negative plate, in which the metal leaf becomes the background to a design which is revealed in the colour of the paper. The paper used prior to metal-leaf embossing could be uncoloured, already coloured (brush-colouring, engine-colouring, paste paper, etc.) or decorated with a variety of techniques including stencilling, hand-colouring, sprinkling etc.
A specific type of brocade paper, called drap d’or, was first coloured through stencils, then metal-leaf embossed and finally coloured by hand afterwards in specific areas of the design (hand-colouring), in order to enhance parts of the decoration (e.g. petals or flower leaves).
A very rare type of decorated paper was created by blind-embossing a metallic paper, which was therefore already entirely covered with metal leaf and blind-embossed, before being decorated by hand with coloured paint. Because it is coloured as well as embossed with the same type of plate used for brocade paper, these papers can also be described as brocade papers.

	/** A process by which a paper is coloured all the way through its thickness by means of adding dyes or colours to the pulp in the vat or ‘engine’ during the manufacturing process. One well-known type of engine-coloured paper was named after the English papermaker Thomas Cobb who, in 1796, patented a method for dyeing pulp based on the principles of textile dyeing. Cobb&#039;s finest papers had dark tones, primarily deep browns and olive colours, and were very popular (Krill 1987, Irving 1997). By extension, therefore, many blue papers as well as drab papers manufactured in other mills have sometimes been called Cobb papers, even though there is seldom any evidence that he made them. If his name is to be used to describe such papers, they should be described as ‘Cobb-type papers’. In bookbinding, these papers were extensively used during the first half of the 19th century, if not earlier, both as a covering material and as endleaves  */

Many blue papers from at least the late seventeenth century onwards were made this way, and can be identified under high magnification by the predominant presence of blue fibres in the paper, often of several different shades of blue, and mixed with white fibres in different quantities to create paler or darker blue papers. */
